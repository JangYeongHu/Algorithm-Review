### 문제 설명

<p>It’s dinner time for your pet fox! His meal consists of N crackers, with the ith cracker having a temperature of T<sub>i</sub> degrees Celsius. He also has a large dish of water, which has a temperature of W degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>After taking an initial sip of water, your fox begins his meal. Every time he eats a cracker, its tastiness is equal to the absolute difference between its temperature, and the temperature of the last thing he ate or drank (be it the previous cracker he ate, or a sip of water, whichever he consumed most recently). He can drink some water whenever he wants, and can eat the crackers in any order.</p>

<p>Depending on the order in which your fox eats and drinks, the total tastiness of the crackers consumed may vary. What are the minimum and maximum values it can have?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains two integers, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000) and W (0 ≤ W ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>), representing the number of crackers and the water’s temperature. On the next N lines, there is one integer, T<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ T<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> for 1 ≤ i ≤ N), representing the temperature of the ith cracker.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output is one line containing two integers: the minimum and maximum total tastiness your fox can experience during his meal, respectively.</p>
